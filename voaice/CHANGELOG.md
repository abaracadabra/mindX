## [3.3.0] — 2026-07-17

### Added — the shared sci-fi substrate + a quant-finance accuracy toolset

- **`scifi_substrate.js`** — a shared, dependency-free sci-fi HUD substrate,
  **evolved from the DeltaVerse participant field** (the drifting "stars are
  people") fused with instrument chrome (corner brackets, reticle, grid, sweep).
  It is the **same module** [faicey](https://github.com/Professor-Codephreak/faicey)
  ships, so faicey and voaice now share one visual language across the aivatar
  constellation. Pure layout geometry + a seedable, deterministic particle field
  (4 tests); the canvas draw is the browser layer.
- **`finmeasure.js`** — quantitative-finance estimation applied to voice
  measurement for **accuracy**: a **Kalman filter** stabilises the frequency track
  into an optimal estimate with a **95 % confidence interval**; **jitter / shimmer**
  fall straight out of EWMA volatility (RiskMetrics σ) of the pitch / amplitude
  track — the real forensic voice measures; plus moments (skew/kurtosis),
  Bollinger bands, and z-score **outlier / splice detection**. Everything is
  carried at **conventional EVM 18-decimal precision** (`toFixed18Str`, signed +
  carry-safe — the same fixed-point scale as the voiceprint). 14 tests.
- **README** — a **Professional & scientific** tier table (earned, measured
  fidelity), a minimal oscilloscope display, and the two new modules. The suite
  is cross-linked — faicey (FACE) · facerig (RIG) · voaice (VOICE) — and framed as
  **ollywoo**, the whole thing from the high-end UI, staged inside **DeltaVerse**
  where **irecto** directs and deploys. 50 offline tests.

## [3.2.0] — 2026-07-16

### Added

- **The forensic voice lab** — an elegant, corporate scientific admin panel at
  `/voicelab` (also `/lab`, `/forensic`). Accordion sections (native
  `<details>`): **Synthesis** (every installed voice — all ~100 pyttsx3 OS
  voices — with rate and volume), **Voice modification** (pitch, formant, EQ,
  compressor, de-esser via the in-house VoiceShaper), **Output quality** (format
  and quality tier), **Input quality** (SNR, capture verdict, speech ratio,
  integrity), and **Forensic voiceprint** (the six SoundWave measures at 18 dp,
  a reproducible signature, and `set reference` / `match`). Sans-serif chrome
  with monospace reserved for measured numbers — the way a lab read-out
  separates labels from data — a restrained teal-green accent on graphite, and
  both light and dark themes with a toggle.
- **`voices` command** on the Python tool + `PythonSpeech.voices()` — enumerates
  every voice/model the installed engines expose (pyttsx3 voices with their
  languages/gender + settable rate/volume ranges, Coqui models, vosk models on
  disk, whisper sizes). `--volume` added to `tts`.
- **Panel endpoints** on the voaice server: `/api/py/voices`, `/api/py/tts`
  (synthesise with settings, then measure — the forensic read-out travels with
  the audio), `/api/measure` (scientific voiceprint + SNR + integrity),
  `/api/shape` (apply a VoiceShaper chain).

## [3.1.1] — 2026-07-16

### Added

- **`python/install.sh` — one-command venv install.** Creates a virtualenv
  (`python/.venv`) and installs the speech backends you choose: `light` (pyttsx3
  + vosk, offline, torch-free — the default), `--online` (gTTS +
  SpeechRecognition), or `--full` (Coqui TTS + openai-whisper). Checks the Python
  version, needs no root, and tells you the one apt package to install if
  `python3 -m venv` isn't available rather than sudo'ing on your behalf. Grouped
  `requirements-{light,online,full}.txt` back it (the old `requirements.txt` was
  entirely commented and installed nothing).
- **The Node bridge auto-detects the venv.** `PythonSpeech` now prefers
  `python/.venv/bin/python` when present (then `VOAICE_PYTHON`, then PATH), so
  after one `install.sh` it just works with no configuration.

### Fixed

- **`PythonSpeech.capability()` returned nothing.** The bridge parsed only the
  last line of the tool's output, but `capability` pretty-prints multi-line JSON
  — so it silently lost the report. It now parses the whole body first, falling
  back to the last line. (`tts`/`stt` emit single-line JSON and were unaffected.)

### Verified

Real round-trip on this host: `install.sh` built the venv, pyttsx3 synthesised a
90 KB WAV, vosk resolved as the STT engine; a new test covers the synthesis path
when an engine is installed. Suite: voicey (11) + v3 (16) + python (5).

---

## [3.1.0] — 2026-07-16

### Added

- **Python TTS/STT bridge** (`voaice/python`). The voaice core stays torch-free
  JS DSP; some speech stacks only live in Python (Coqui TTS, whisper, vosk…), so
  this reaches them **when a host has them** and degrades honestly when it
  doesn't — the same doctrine as the JS `voaice/tts` / `voaice/stt`.
  - `python/voaice_speech.py` — a dependency-probing CLI: `capability`, `tts`
    (Coqui → pyttsx3 → gTTS), `stt` (whisper → vosk → SpeechRecognition). JSON
    on stdout; with no engine installed it exits non-zero with a structured
    `{error}` + install hint, and `stt` **never invents a transcript**.
  - `PythonSpeech` (`src/python_speech.js`) — the Node wrapper: `capability()`,
    `available()`, `tts(text, out)`, `stt(wavPath)`. Probes first; a missing
    engine or a missing Python is a clear error, not a fake result.
  - `python/requirements.txt` + `python/README.md`: install only what you need;
    nothing is required by the voaice core.

## [3.0.0] — 2026-07-14

**The complete voice stack.** v3 closes the loop: voice comes *in* (speech-to-text,
signal-versus-noise), and voice goes *out* (text-to-speech, shaping), with forensic
measurement, non-destructive editing and quality-tiered export in between. Every
path is modular, every engine loads lazily, and every capability is probed and
reported honestly before it is relied on.

### Added — input

- **`voaice/stt` — Speech to text.** One façade over `whisper.cpp`, `vosk` and
  `sherpa-onnx`, resolved at runtime.
  - **`transcribe()` refuses to invent a transcript** when no recogniser is
    installed: it throws with an install hint. A wrong transcript silently
    poisons everything downstream; no transcript does not.
  - **`segment()` is the zero-dependency floor** — VAD-driven utterance
    segmentation with timings, energy and per-segment SNR. It reports *where*
    the speech is and whether it is clean enough to be worth transcribing, and
    it never claims to be transcription.
- **`voaice/noise` — Signal versus noise.** `snr()` (speech/noise split with a
  graded verdict), `noiseProfile()` (learned from the clearly-quiet frames),
  `denoise()` (spectral subtraction with over-subtraction and a spectral floor),
  `gate()` (click-free noise gate), `spectralFlatness()`.
  - `denoise()` **refuses to invent a noise profile** when a clip contains no
    silence — it returns the input unchanged and says why.

### Added — output

- **`voaice/tts` — Text to speech.** Neural (torch-free ONNX) → native OS engines
  (`espeak-ng`, `festival`, `flite`, `pico2wave`, `say`, `piper`) → the in-house
  formant synthesiser. **There is always a voice**: a host with no speech binaries
  and no model weights still speaks — audibly synthetic, clearly labelled, never
  silently failing. Every result reports which engine produced it.
- **`voaice/shaper` — Voice shaping.** Editing the *voice*, not the timeline:
  `pitchShift` (constant duration), `timeStretch` (constant pitch), `formantShift`
  (vocal-tract size, independent of pitch — the thing that keeps a shifted voice
  human), RBJ-biquad `eq`, `compress`, `deEss`, `breath`. Chainable and undoable
  via `VoiceShaper`, matching the `AudioEditor` contract.

### Fixed — the forensic model

Building the v3 suites surfaced defects serious enough to be worth naming plainly.
A forensic tool that cries wolf on honest evidence is not a conservative tool; it
is a broken one.

- **`Forensic.integrity()` no longer condemns an honest recording for having
  pauses.** Every real capture starts and stops speaking, and each onset is a
  large, abrupt rise in level — a naive amplitude-jump detector calls all of them
  splices. The model is now sound: speech↔silence transitions are *ignored* (that
  is a person talking); a discontinuity is flagged only **inside a run of speech**
  (a cut within a sentence); and a **noise-floor shift** detector catches the real
  signature of stitched material — two different rooms in one file. It also no
  longer reports false splices on near-stationary audio, where the diff standard
  deviation collapses and ordinary numerical wobble scored as tampering.
- **`snr()` returns `null` with `verdict: 'unmeasurable'`** for a clip that
  contains no silence, instead of inventing a floor. Signal-to-noise is measured
  *against* a noise floor, and a clip with no pauses does not contain one. Supply
  `opts.noiseClip` — a few seconds of room tone, which is what a studio records
  first — and it becomes measurable again. Unmeasured is never passed off as zero.
- **`snr()` and `noiseProfile()` detect the floor with a tighter gate (15 dB)**
  than the speech VAD (35 dB). The speech VAD deliberately keeps quiet consonants;
  a floor detector that generous classifies the room itself as speech, then reports
  "unmeasurable" exactly when a clip is noisy enough to need the number.
- **`deEss()` rebuilt as a proper two-band crossover.** Subtracting a highpassed
  copy from the original does not work: the filter phase-shifts the extracted band,
  so the subtraction fails to cancel and can *add* energy at the target frequency.
- `Forensic.voiceprint()` evenly subsamples long clips (`maxFrames`, default 400)
  instead of analysing every frame. A few hundred well-spread frames describe a
  speaker as well as thousands, at a fraction of the cost.

### Changed

- `encodeWav()` takes `{ bitDepth: 16 | 24 | 32 }` (32 = IEEE float). Default
  remains 16-bit — existing callers are unaffected.
- Test suites split: `npm test` runs the fast, offline suites (27 checks, seconds).
  `npm run test:all` adds the neural suite, which loads real model weights when
  present.

### Package

`npm run capability` prints exactly what this host can synthesise and recognise.
15 export paths; zero required dependencies beyond `d3` (oscilloscope only).
Consumed by [aivatar](https://github.com/Professor-Codephreak/aivatar) ≥ 1.1.0, whose
capture-intake stage grades the room a reference was recorded in.

## [2.x] — 2026-07-13

- **`voaice/forensic`** — voiceprint identity, speaker comparison with verdict
  bands, tamper/splice screening, hash-linked chain-of-custody.
- **`voaice/editor`** — non-destructive clip operations plus an undoable
  `AudioEditor` session.
- **`voaice/exporter`** — quality-tiered export: `.wav` (16/24/32-float) in-house,
  `.ogg` Vorbis via the system ffmpeg, with an honest `oggAvailable()` gate.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06

- Initial separation from faicey: in-house DSP (FFT, spectrometer, LUFS, VAD),
  `Scientific` 18-decimal measurement, oscilloscope, OS and neural TTS with
  zero-shot cloning.
